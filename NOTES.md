Enhancement Ideas
=================
- contrail particles from flaps when active
- camera follow plane with slight delay to emphasize motion
- cycle camera between modes
	- behind
	- side
	- front (add a cockpit texture if I do this)
- animate flap motion instead of instant rotation
- ground & building collission
	- toss up debris (billboard particles) on impacts
	- "bounce" off of ground
	- buildings and plane on fire if struck - for 10s maybe
- retractable landing gears
- adjustable speed
- possible to land/take off
- "win" the game by landing at airport
- get some points by flying through rings
- achievements (barrell roll, loop, fly inverted N secs, crashed, flew to space)
- trend controls back toward neutral upright if no input
- HUD controls for altimeter, speedometer, landing gear indicator, crash warning, stall warning
- stall if pointed up (have to look this up - what causes stall)
- health bar for plane - reduced by impacts
	- plane explodes or crashes if out of health
